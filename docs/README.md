# ErgoPad Documentaion

## Introduction

ErgoPad is a project incubator offering token IDOs which provide funding for new projects within the Ergo ecosystem. Ergopad will release its own native token through an IDO (Initial Dex Offering), and users will be able to trade Ergo or SigUSD for these tokens and stake them through smart contracts.

If you stake ErgoPad tokens and reach one of the tiers outlined in the staking section, you'll be given an opportunity to invest in seed sales for new projects. These seed sale prices will often be much lower than the price the tokens list at during the IDO.

SigUSD and Erg raised in the pre-sales will be used to build projects on the Ergo platform, to build out the ecosystem of dApps and bring the DeFi functionality needed to make Ergo a top 10 coin.

## Disclaimer

All information is subject to change. 

Using the ergopad.io website is not the same as using the Ergo blockchain. When you use the ErgoPad website to generate transactrions for you, you'll still need to use a native Ergo wallet to send the transactions and interact with the blockchain. 

Connecting your wallet on the ergopad.io website doesn't give the website any control over your funds. It stores the public address of your Ergo wallet in localStorage on your device, and will use that data to compile ergoscript contracts for you to interact with on chain. The data will never be stored on the ergopad.io servers. 

## Our Philosophy

We believe that all people should have full access to and full control over their finances. No government should have the right to control what someone can and can't invest in, or how they can spend their money. We also believe control of the money supply should be taken from governments, since governments have proven they don't take the responsibility seriously enough, and contiunue to choose profits for the ultra-wealthy over fairness for common people.

As the government attempts to print us out of problems of their making, the resulting inflation erodes people's buying power. Corporations continue to charge more for goods and services, while refusing to give fair wages to workers.

Beginning with Bitcoin, cryptocurrency became a financial revolution that can help free people from this cycle. While Bitcoin gave us a fantastic store of value, Ethereum proved that on-chain dApps could replace much of the financial services we traditionally have relied on investment banks and large hedge funds to provide. Anyone who has used Ethereum knows there are flaws in the design; you find out quick when a transaction costs over $80 USD in gas fees. However, it was a great proof of concept, and Ergo is here to carry that torch to the next stage of development. With a robust PoW backing, novel concepts like extended-UTXO, NIPOPOWs, and Sigma protocols, Ergo is set to be the next iteration in blockchain ecosystem solutions.

Because the eUTXO system is still in its infancy, the user experience is severly lacking in comparison to other projects like Ethereum that have had a several year head start. However, that leaves a lot of room for growth, and we would like to be part of that growth.

ErgoPad was created to generate financial backing for the developers who need it, so we can help the Ergo platform grow into a safe, accessible financial ecosystem where everyone has fair access. All dApps should provide an experience where a user's data is only shared when they want it to, and where they can leverage or spend their money any way they wish with minimal fees for doing so. Some devs don't have strong marketing skills, and other teams have a great idea and community but no devs to build it. That's where we come in. We can put teams together, raise funds, grow the communities, and create the future of free market access for all. We'd love to have you join us on this journey!

## Tokenomics

- Token Name: ErgoPad
- Token ID: TBD
- Blockchain: Ergo
- Initial supply: 79M
- Total supply: 400M

### Early Investment Rounds

Early investment rounds will take place starting December 17, 2021. The seed round and strategic round will be capped at 5k sigUSD and 20k sigUSD per person, respectively. There will be a max allocation of 10M tokens for seed round, and 20M tokens for strategic round and pre-sale. You will be able to send Erg native coins to a smart contract and will receive ErgoPad tokens in return, locked according to the vesting schedule. Once each vesting period has passed, you'll be able to claim your tokens that are unlocked for that period. We will provide a form on the website to generate the transaction, to keep it simple. 

### Dao tokens

The ErgoPad DAO will receive 6% of the total supply of tokens. This will be released quarterly to the DAO over 6 quarters (one and a half years). The DAO will vote to determine how those tokens will be spent. Salaries, new hires, marketing, buybacks, and other expenses will be considered, and remaining tokens will be burned. 

### Tokenomics and Vesting Schedule

Distributed to | Amount | Price Per Token | Max per person | Percent of IDO | Vesting Period
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Seed Round | 10M | 0.011 sigUSD | 5k sigUSD | 12.7% | 1/9th Monthly for 9 Months
Strategic Round | 20M | 0.02 sigUSD | 20k sigUSD | 25.3% | 1/6th Monthly for 6 Months
Pre-Sale | 20M | 0.03 sigUSD | No limit | 25.3% | 1/3 Monthly for 3 Months
Liquidity | 5M | 0.04 sigUSD | N/A | 6.3% | Immediate
DAO | 24M | N/A | N/A | 30.3% | Quarterly for 6 Quarters
Staking | 321M | N/A | N/A | N/A | Daily for 36 months


## Staking

Staking provides a few utilites. Staking your ErgoPad tokens will generate new tokens based on the number you have staked and the emission schdule. If you reach one of the staking tiers, you'll get pool allocation which gives you an opportunity to buy into new projects launched on ErgoPad at seed-sale prices not always open to the public. 

### Tiers

Tier | Amount | Whitelist Requirements | Allocation Weight
--- | --- | --- | ---
(A) Alpha	| 50000	| Twitter like, comment, and retweet | 3
(Β) Beta | 100000 | Twitter like, comment, and retweet | 10
(Ω) Omega	| 250000	| Twitter like, retweet | 25
(Φ) Phi	| 500000	| Twitter like | 60
(Σ) Sigma	| 1500000 | none | 200

#### Pool Allocation

Pool allocation will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Each project will have some tokens reserved for ErgoPad stakers at a reduced price. Staking snapshot will be announced ahead of time, and anyone staking in a tier during that time will be eligible for the number of tokens based on their pool weight. 

Eg. if 1000 tokens are available for stakers, and there are 5 people staking at the Sigma level, each of those 5 people will have an opportunity to buy 200 tokens for the project. This is an over-simplified example just to illustrate the concept. There will usually be people staking at all tier levels and many more tokens available. 

### Emission

There will be 400M total ErgoPad tokens, and these will be given to stakers over a 3 year period. The APR will vary day-to-day based on the number of staked tokens and the total coins left. Information on the APR and staking will be available at ergopad.io/staking when you connect your wallet to the website. 

### Instructions

To stake your tokens, navigate to ergopad.io/staking and in the top-right corner, click "connect wallet." Add the wallet address that has the ErgoPad tokens you'd like to stake. Then, press the "stake now" button. 

A modal will pop up where you enter the number of tokens you'd like to stake. Enter that number and choose "stake" and the assembler will generate a UTXO transaction for you in a compiled hash. Copy that hash and go to your Ergo wallet of choice. Send the exact number of ErgoPad tokens you typed into the modal on the website, and the exact amount of Erg the website instructed, to cover transaction fees, and send it to the hash generated by the website that you copied before. That's it. If the transaction doesn't work for some reason, it'll refund everything. If all goes well, you should be able to see your staked tokens on the staking page of the website under "Your Holdings." 

Your stake will be auto-compounded for you. To withdraw, just press the withdraw button and follow the instructions which will be exactly like the staking instructions. 

Note: there are fees for unstaking early. 

#### Early Unstaking Fees

Fee	| Time staked
--- | ---
25%	| Less than 2 weeks
20%	| Between 2 and 4 weeks
12.5%	| Between 4 and 6 weeks
5% | Between 6 and 8 weeks
0% | More than 8 weeks
